## Taking Antenna Measurements with [NanoVNA](https://nanovna.com)

**Before measuring:**
- Calibrate your NanoVNA using a calibration kit (SOL: Short, Open, Load)
- Ensure calibration covers your frequency range of interest
- Use quality coaxial cables and minimize cable length
- Allow the NanoVNA to warm up for 5-10 minutes before calibration

**During measurement:**
- Keep the antenna away from metal objects, walls, and your body (at least 3 wavelengths)
- Measure in an open area or anechoic environment when possible
- Ensure good connection between antenna and NanoVNA (tight, clean connectors)
- Take measurements at multiple orientations

**What to avoid:**
- Don't touch the antenna or feed line during measurement
- Avoid measuring near other antennas or RF sources
- Don't use damaged or dirty connectors
- Avoid excessive cable coiling or sharp bends
- Don't rush - take multiple measurements for consistency
- Avoid measuring in windy conditions for wire antennas

**Documentation:**
- Leave at least one link where antenna could be bought
- Leave full vendor name and antenna model if available
- Include stated frequency range, measurement setup, optionally add environment description
- Provide clear photo(s) of the antenna and measurement setup
- Provide measurement screenshots from NanoVNA and text representation of the data on them
  - Screenshots should be saved in PNG with compression to avoid large size
- Record SWR, return loss, and impedance data
- Note any limitations or unusual conditions during measurement
