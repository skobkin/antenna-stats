> [!IMPORTANT]
> ~~Only one antenna was measured, so it's not unrealistic to assume that it could be a defective item. But it's also a good idea to order it in a store where you can return it easily if the problem occurs.~~
> A total of 7 antennas was measured. All of them were tuned to ~950MHz instead of 868MHz. Even on ~950MHz they had SWR of ~1.6 which is more than declared on the product page.
